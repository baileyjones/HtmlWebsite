<h2>Lossy And Lossless Images</h2>
<h2>The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</h2>
<h3>One (lossless) allows for all of the original data to be recovered whenever the file is uncompressed again.The other (lossy) works differently since it ends up eliminating all the “unnecessary” bits and pieces of information in the original file to make it smaller when compressed</h3>
<h2>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h2>
<h3>As images continue to be the largest part of webpage content, it’s critically important for web developers to take aggressive control of their image sizes and quality in order to deliver a fastest loading, responsive site for their users</h3>
<h2>The effects of lossy and lossless compression</h2>
<h3>Lossy compression refers to compression in which some of the data from the original file (JPEG) is lost. The process is irreversible, once you convert to lossy, you can’t go back. Lossless compression refers to compression in which the image is reduced without any quality loss. Usually this is done by removing unnecessary metadata from JPEG and PNG files</h3>
